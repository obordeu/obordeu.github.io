Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor at [UC Berkeley](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) [Haas School of Business](https://haas.berkeley.edu).

I am interested in urban and spatial economics. I study the mechanisms behind different geographic costs or frictions, for example, the determinants of commuting costs in cities, migration costs, and capital costs across cities. 

You can reach me at [oliviabordeu@berkeley.edu](mailto:oliviabordeu@berkeley.edu)

I co-organize the [Online Spatial and Urban Seminar (OSUS)](https://osus.info/). Check it out!
