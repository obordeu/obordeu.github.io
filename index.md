Welcome! I am an IES Postdoctoral Fellow at [Princeton University](https://ies.princeton.edu/). I will join the Haas School of Business at [UC Berkeley](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in 2025.

I am interested in urban and spatial economics. I study the mechanisms behind different geographic costs or frictions, for example, the determinants of commuting costs in cities, migration costs, and capital costs across cities. 

I completed my Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 2024.

You can reach me at [ogazmuri@princeton.edu](mailto:ogazmuri@princeton.edu)

I co-organize the [Online Spatial and Urban Seminar](osus.info). Check it out!
