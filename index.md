Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. 

I will join the Haas School of Business at the [UC Berkeley](https://haas.berkeley.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in 2025 after one year as an IES Postdoctoral Fellow at [Princeton University](https://ies.princeton.edu/).

I am interested in trade and spatial economics. I study the mechanisms behind different geographic costs or frictions, for example, the determinants of commuting costs, migration costs, and capital costs across cities.
