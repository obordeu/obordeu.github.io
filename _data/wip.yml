Using loan-level data from Chile, we document interest rate differences both across cities within the same bank and between banks within the same city, consistent with the theoretical mechanisms we propose. We develop a quantitative spatial model with banks that allows us to quantify the impact of the bank network on spatial inequality. Preliminary analysis indicates that pro-competitive reforms in the banking sector increase aggregate welfare by 1.63% and lead to significant reductions in spatial inequality.'}
