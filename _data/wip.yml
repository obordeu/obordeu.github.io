Firms in cities with relatively high borrowing costs pay around 280 basis points more than firms in low-cost cities. While these estimates control for different firm and loan compositions across cities, we find evidence that they are related to concentration in the local loan market. We examine the pass-through of monetary policy to lending rates and find that banks with higher local market shares exhibit stronger pass-through, aligning with oligopolistic models of branch competition."}
