Using data on banks operating in Chile, we show that bank-level deposit shocks lead receiving banks to increase lending and lower interest rates relative to other banks: a 1\% increase in deposits raises loans by 0.31\% and reduces interest rates by 96.7 basis points. The additional lending is directed toward cities where the bank has a small market share and little impact on interest rates, consistent with local market power. We develop a quantitative spatial model of nationally chartered banks operating in oligopolistic local credit markets and frictions to interbank lending, disciplined to match the empirical results. Interbank frictions have modest aggregate effects, lowering steady-state GDP by about 0.1%, while spatial variation in loan markups reduces GDP by about 0.3%. Bank mergers improve financial integration but reduce competition, generating heterogeneous welfare effects that depend on the merging banks’ geographic overlap."}
