Using data from Chile, we show that banks that experience regional deposit shocks increase lending in all cities relative to non-exposed banks, indicating a limited role for the interbank market. We develop a novel quantitative spatial model with oligopolistic banks and frictions in the interbank market. Using the quantified version of the model, we find that interbank frictions generate productivity costs of 2.7% of GDP, while market power plays a larger role. Bank mergers improve financial integration across cities at the cost of reduced competition in the banking industry. The welfare effects of mergers range between -5.7% and +0.6%, depending on the geographic footprint of the merging banks."}
