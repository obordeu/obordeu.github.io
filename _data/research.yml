- {name: 'Transportation Infrastructure in Fragmented Cities <em>(Job Market Paper)</em>', coauthors: '', coathors_website: '', summary: 'Cities are often divided into local governments responsible for local infrastructure investments. In this paper, I study how this metropolitan fragmentation affects the provision of commuting infrastructure and the distribution of economic activity. I develop a quantitative spatial model in which local governments compete for residents and workers by investing in commuting infrastructure to maximize net land value in their jurisdiction. In equilibrium, relative to a central metropolitan planner, municipalities underinvest in areas near their boundaries and overinvest in areas where they can poach people from other jurisdictions. Infrastructure investment in fragmented cities results in higher cross-jurisdiction commuting costs, more dispersed employment, and a more polycentric city. Estimating the model using data from Santiago, Chile, I find substantial gains from centralization. Centralizing investment decisions would increase infrastructure investment, population, and aggregate land value net of building costs. The centralized planner particularly invests in municipalities adjacent to more productive or attractive jurisdictions, as the benefits of this infrastructure largely accrue to their neighbors.' }

We start by showing that lower-income households are less geographically mobile than their higher-income counterparts. Zooming in on childcare needs, we document that lower-income families rely more on local friends and relatives for their childcare needs rather than using market providers. Further, households living close to their local social networks are less likely to move, with lower income households showing the most negative effects. We propose a dynamic model of households' joint location and childcare production and estimate it by matching key moments in the data. Then, we quantify how this local social capital mechanism accounts for the patterns present in the data. Finally, we study the recently proposed American Families Plan, which heavily subsidizes market-based child care for lower-income households."}
