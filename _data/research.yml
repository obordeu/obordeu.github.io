- {name: 'Transportation Distortions in Fragmented Cities',coathors: '',summary: 'Cities are often divided into local governments, which invest in commuting infrastructure within their jurisdictions. In this paper, I study the implications of this metropolitan fragmentation on the provision of commuting infrastructure and the distribution of economic activity. I develop a quantitative equilibrium model of a city where local governments compete for residents and workers by investing in commuting infrastructure to maximize their land value. In this framework, fragmentation leads to the underprovision of commuting infrastructure and employment decentralization. I calibrate and fit the model to the city of Santiago, Chile, which is divided into 32 municipalities (in progress).' }
