- {name: 'Transportation Infrastructure in Fragmented Cities <em>(Job Market Paper)</em>', coauthors: '', coathors_website: '', summary: 'Cities are often divided into municipalities responsible for local infrastructure investments. In this paper, I study how this metropolitan fragmentation affects the provision of commuting infrastructure and the distribution of economic activity. I develop a quantitative spatial model in which municipalities compete for residents and workers by investing in commuting infrastructure to maximize net land value in their jurisdictions. In equilibrium, relative to a central metropolitan planner, municipalities underinvest in areas near their boundaries and overinvest in other areas. Infrastructure investment in fragmented cities results in higher cross-jurisdiction commuting costs, more dispersed employment, and more polycentric patterns of economic activity. Estimating the model using data from Santiago, Chile, I find substantial gains from centralization. Centralization increases aggregate infrastructure investment and population. More importantly, however, centralization results in large welfare gains due solely to more efficient infrastructure allocation, holding the budget fixed.' }

We start by showing that lower-income households are less geographically mobile than their higher-income counterparts. Zooming in on childcare needs, we document that lower-income families rely more on local friends and relatives for their childcare needs rather than using market providers. Further, households living close to their local social networks are less likely to move, with lower income households showing the most negative effects. We propose a dynamic model of households' joint location and childcare production and estimate it by matching key moments in the data. Then, we quantify how this local social capital mechanism accounts for the patterns present in the data. Finally, we study the recently proposed American Families Plan, which heavily subsidizes market-based child care for lower-income households."}
